## Content so far!

As of now, I have created:

- Scraps
	- Wormted Poster
	- NBickles
	- Moo Cow
	
And hope to add more soon! Make suggestions in the Discord!

## WILD/CARD

Last but not least, thank you to WILD/CARD and all members for making such great content and being a source of comfort and joy for me and many others. I can't lie and say I don't have my favourites (guess who) but I do hope to eventually have something to represent everyone!
